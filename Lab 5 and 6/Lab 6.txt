10. The TCP window increases non-linearly to implement congestion control, preventing network overload by gradually increasing the transmission rate.
11. With an MSS of 1000 bytes and an RTT of 100ms, the sender would fully utilize the window after 50ms, which is the one-way latency.
12. 300ms
13. 1200ms
14. 300ms since it includes three full cycles of the RTT, which is given as 100ms.
15. D is higher than B because other people sharing the network may have increased the overall network traffic, leading to increased congestion, which triggers the TCP congestion control.
